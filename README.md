Our final project explores the relationship between income, density of liquor stores, and the DUI rates of a neighborhood. We seek to find which of the two factors has a stronger influence, if at all, on DUI rates. Our analysis includes data from 4 different sets that were cleaned and statistically analyzed with linear regressions, OLS tests, and t-tests.

Research Question: Does the average income and/or density of liquor-selling businesses in a San Diego zip code influence the amount of DUI tickets given in the area? Which factor has a stronger correlation to DUI rates?

Hypothesis: We have three hypotheses to answer the two parts of our research question.

  1. We hypothesize that median_income in a zip code has a negative correlation with DUI rate in that zip code and that the        density of liquor-selling businesses in a zip code has a positive correlation with DUI rate.
  2. We hypothesize that liquor store density has a stronger correlation to the DUI rates of a neighborhood.
  3. We hypothesize that there is a statistically significant relationship that can be found in liquor store density  influencing DUI rates in neighbors, and a statistically significant relationship can be found between median zip code income and DUI rate. 
  
Conclusion: Density of liquor stores of a zipcode is statistically significant in predicting DUI rate! More liquor stores per person in a zipcode means more DUIs. While there a small negative correlation between income and DUI rate, it wasn't statistically significant, so we cannot say that income has an influence on causing DUI rates in San Diego zip codes. Our hypothesis accurately predicted that there is a correlation between liquore store density and DUI rates, however we were proven wrong about the influence of income on DUI rates.
